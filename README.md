# Smart-Wearable-Airbag-Prototype

A wearable airbag system designed to protect **elderly people** and **small children** from injury during falls.  
The system uses **MPU6050** for fall detection, **NodeMCU** for processing, and integrates with **Blynk IoT** for real-time monitoring.  
This is a **prototype version** built for demonstration purposes.

## üìå Features
- **Fall Detection** using MPU6050 accelerometer + gyroscope.
- **Automatic Airbag Deployment** using relay-controlled inflation (fan-based prototype).
- **Wireless Data Transmission** via NodeMCU (ESP8266).
- **Real-time Monitoring** using Blynk IoT on Android.
- **Compact & Wearable** design for elderly and children.

## üõ† Components Used
| Component | Quantity | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| NodeMCU ESP8266 | 1 | Main control unit |
| MPU6050 | 1 | Detects angle & motion |
| Relay Module | 1 | Controls airbag inflation mechanism |
| Fan (prototype) / CO‚ÇÇ Canister (future) | 1 | Airbag inflation |
| Power Source | 1 | Battery for portability |
| Blynk IoT App | - | Monitoring & data logging |

## ‚öô How It Works
1. **Detection** ‚Äì MPU6050 continuously measures tilt and acceleration.
2. **Decision** ‚Äì If fall angle exceeds the threshold, NodeMCU triggers the deployment.
3. **Activation** ‚Äì Relay turns on inflation system (fan in prototype).
4. **Monitoring** ‚Äì Data sent to Blynk IoT for remote viewing.

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Replace fan with **CO‚ÇÇ canister mechanism** for instant inflation.
- Add **Pulse Oximeter** for vitals monitoring.
- Implement **LoRa communication** for long-range alerting.
- Compact 3D-printed housing for better wearability.
